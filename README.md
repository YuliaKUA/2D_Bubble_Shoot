# 2D_Bubble_Shoot
Coursework in the discipline of object oriented programming in Java.

Implemented a simple 2D shooter, using swing and awt libraries for graphics.

The goal of the game is to destroy all the enemies, while they don't hurt you. 
Enemies are circles of different sizes and colors (randomly selected) appear on top. 
The player is a circle of purple, can move in 8 options: left / right, up / down and diagonally.
In addition to the “main window” of the game, there is a special field where the player sees the current score and the number of lives.

The results of all games are recorded in a separate file and then you can see the statistics of wins on points.


Update soon
